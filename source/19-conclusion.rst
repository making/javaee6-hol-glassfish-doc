Conclusion
===================

This hands-on lab created a typical 3-tier Java EE 6 application using Java Persistence API (JPA), Servlet, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS), Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI), and Bean Validation. It also explained how typical design patterns required in a web application can be easily implemented using these technologies.
Hopefully this has raised your interest enough in trying out Java EE 6 applications using GlassFish and NetBeans.
