"This hands-on lab builds a typical 3-tier Java EE 6 Web application that "
"retrieves customer information from a database and displays it in a Web "
"page. The application also allows new customers to be added to the database "
"as well. The string-based and type-safe queries are used to query and add "
"rows to the database. Each row in the database table is published as a "
"RESTful resource and is then accessed programmatically. Typical design "
"patterns required by a Web application like validation, caching, observer, "
"partial page rendering, and cross-cutting concerns like logging are "
"explained and implemented using different Java EE 6 technologies."

"**Disclaimer**: This is a sample application and the code may not be "
"following the best practices to prevent SQL injection, cross-side scripting "
"attacks, escaping parameters, and other similar features expected of a "
"robust enterprise application. This is intentional such as to stay focused "
"on explaining the technology. Each of this topic can take its own hands-on "
"lab and there is enough material available on the Internet. Its highly "
"recommended to make sure that the code copied from this sample application "
"is updated to meet those requirements."
