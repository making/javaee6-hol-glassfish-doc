"Notice, that even though the output from the toString is correctly updated, "
"indicating the app was redeployed successfully, the session access count was "
"incremented by one. This shows that the session attributes were preserved "
"across the redeployment. This boosts developer's productivity because HTTP "
"session, which is where typically application's login information might be "
"stored, is not invalidated if your application is redeployed. This is an "
"optional feature and can be disabled by viewing the properties of the "
"GlassFish server in the “Services” tab of NetBeans and unselecting “Preserve "
"Sessions Across Redeployment”."
