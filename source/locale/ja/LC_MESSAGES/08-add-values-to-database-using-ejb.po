"Bean Validation is a new specification added to the Java EE 6 platform. This "
"specification defines an extensible validation constraints mechanism, with a "
"pre-defined set of constraints, that can be specified on field, method, "
"type, or annotations. It also defines a validation facility for the Java "
"application developer."
