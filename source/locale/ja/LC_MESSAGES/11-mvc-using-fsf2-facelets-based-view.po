"JavaServer Faces 2 allows Facelets to be used as the view templates. This "
"has huge benefits as Facelets are created using only XHTML and CSS and rest "
"of the business logic is contained in the backing beans. This ensures that "
"MVC architecture recommended by JSF can be easily achieved. The model is "
"provided by the JPA entity, the view is served by JSF2, and controller is an "
"EJB. Even though JSPs can still be used as view templates but Facelets are "
"highly recommended with JSF2."

"The Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) is a new specification in the "
"Java EE 6 platform and bridges the gap between the transactional and the Web "
"tier by allowing EJBs to be used as the “backing beans” of the JSF pages. "
"This eliminates the need for any “glue code”, such as JSF managed beans, and "
"there by further simplifying the Java EE platform."
