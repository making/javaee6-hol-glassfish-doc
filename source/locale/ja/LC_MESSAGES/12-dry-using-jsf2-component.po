"The JSF2 specification defines a composite component as a component that "
"consists of one or more JSF components defined in a Facelet markup file that "
"resides inside a resource library. The composite component is defined in the "
"defining page and used in the using page. The defining page defines the "
"metadata (or parameters) using ``<cc:interface>`` and implementation using "
"``<cc:implementation>`` where cc is the prefix for the http://java.sun.com/"
