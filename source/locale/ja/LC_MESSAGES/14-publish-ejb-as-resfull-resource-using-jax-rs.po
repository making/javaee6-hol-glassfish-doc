"The JAX-RS 1.1 specification defines a standard API to provide support for "
"RESTful Web services in the Java platform. Just like other Java EE 6 "
"technologies, any POJO can be easily converted into a RESTful resource by "
"adding the @Path annotation. JAX-RS 1.1 allows an EJB to be published as a "
"RESTful entity."
