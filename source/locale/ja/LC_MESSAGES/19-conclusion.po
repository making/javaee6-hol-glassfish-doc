"This hands-on lab created a typical 3-tier Java EE 6 application using Java "
"Persistence API (JPA), Servlet, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), JavaServer Faces "
"(JSF), Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS), Contexts and Dependency "
"Injection (CDI), and Bean Validation. It also explained how typical design "
"patterns required in a web application can be easily implemented using these "
"technologies. Hopefully this has raised your interest enough in trying out "
"Java EE 6 applications using GlassFish and NetBeans."
